The assertion that Disney's creative decisions are to blame for the MCU's recent struggles prompts a deeper examination. It is crucial to differentiate between superhero fatigue and specific creative missteps. Several other superhero-related series and movies have flourished during the same period, challenging the notion of a saturated market. My focus is on understanding the unique challenges faced by MCU. The hypothesis is that Disney bears responsibility for the MCU's underperformance invites scrutiny. This claim extends beyond mere disappointment in superhero movies; it reflects a broader concern about Disney's handling of iconic franchises from our childhood. If not addressed, the same fate may befall other beloved franchises, marking a trend that could negatively impact the entire entertainment industry.
